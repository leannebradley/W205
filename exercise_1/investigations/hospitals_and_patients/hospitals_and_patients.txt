The correlation coefficient between hospitals' overall survey scores and their relative score,calculated based on Timely and Effective Care and Readmissions and Death, is 0.1623.

For this question I used the corr() function, which returns the Pearson coefficient of correlation for a pair of columns.  

The result, 0.1623, indicates that there is a very weak but positive relationship between between survey scores and each hospitals' relative score, as defined earlier.
